- add custom colors to diff wavelengths
- highlight path difference (2 beams from slits shining on mouse on screen?)
- highlight how these 2 waves interfere to give screen pattern (draw lines to show peak + peak?)
- show sine wave on these 2 beams / paths
- blogpost-esque description below
- diffraction grating
